### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Pre-Final Year Undergraduate Student in the field of Electronics and Communication Engineering at Visvesvaraya National Institue of Technology, Nagpur. I'm quite passionate about Robotics and the Maths behind it. I believe that every problem in this world can be solved with the advancement of technology.

More about me:
