### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Pre-Final Year Undergraduate Student in the field of Electronics and Communication Engineering at [Visvesvaraya National Institue of Technology, Nagpur](https://vnit.ac.in/). I'm quite passionate about Robotics and the Maths behind it. I believe that every problem in this world can be solved with the advancement of technology.

More about me:

- ðŸ”­ I'm an active member of [IvLabs](https://www.ivlabs.in/), a Robotics and AI Research Lab at VNIT, Nagpur. Checkout the interesting projects that my group and I are working on.
- ðŸ’¬ I have worked in the field of Mobile Robotics, particularly in the field of Localization, Multiview Geometry, Computer Vision and Sensor Fusion.
- ðŸ˜„ Iâ€™m currently working on stablizing a [UAV during its transition from an Outdoor Environment to a GPS-denied environment](https://github.com/Kush0301/UAV-Localization) and [Sparse 3D Reconstruction](https://github.com/Kush0301/Structure-from-Motion).
- :mag: My current research lies in the field of Graph based algorithms for Localization and tightly coupled fusion of an IMU with that of camera providing Visual Odometry.
- :stars: My goal is to build a fully autonomous robot from scratch.
