### Hi there 👋

I’m a Pre-Final Year Undergraduate Student in the field of Electronics and Communication Engineering at Visvesvaraya National Institue of Technology, Nagpur. I'm quite passionate about Robotics and the Maths behind it. I believe that every problem in this world can be solved with the advancement of technology.

More about me:

- 🔭 I'm an active member of [IvLabs](https://www.ivlabs.in/), a Robotics and AI Research Lab at VNIT, Nagpur.
- 💬 I have worked in the field of Mobile Robotics, particularly in the field of Localization, Multiview Geometry, Computer Vision and Sensor Fusion.
- 😄 I’m currently working on stablizing a [UAV during its transition from an Outdoor Environment to a GPS-denied environment](https://github.com/Kush0301/UAV-Localization) and [Sparse 3D Reconstruction](https://github.com/Kush0301/Structure-from-Motion).
